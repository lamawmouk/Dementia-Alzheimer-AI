### Project Overview
This project allows for the processing and analyzing neuroimaging data, specifically tailored for the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) Dataset.

#### 1. Dataset 

- Register and gain approval for ADNI Dataset access.
- Extract data with labels from the ADNI Image collection in NIFTI file format.

#### 2. Dependencies Installation

- Ensure installation of required dependencies; refer to the documentation for details.

#### 3. Data Extraction

- Extract pertinent information from NIFTI files for further analysis.

#### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Utilize demographics and historical data for insightful exploratory analysis.

#### 5. Label Extraction for Alzheimer's and Vascular Dementia

- Extract labels for targeted analysis of Alzheimer's and vascular dementia.

#### 6. Model Training

- Train the neuroimaging model using preprocessed data.

#### 7. Evaluation and Results Visualization

- Evaluate model performance and visualize results comprehensively.

#### 8. Image Segmentation using Voxelmorph

- Implement Voxelmorph for enhanced image segmentation.
